```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(broom)
library(janitor)
```

## Read in Data
```{r}
lizards <- read_csv(here("data", "lizards.csv"))
```

Getting Counts of lizards by species:
```{r}
lizards %>% 
  count(spp) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
```


## Make a subset
- UTST lizards
- Sites: IBPE (encoloser grassland site), RABB (Rabbit mequite site), "EAST (East tarbush site)
- Tail condition is recorded (W = whole, B = broken)

```{r}
utst <- lizards %>% 
  filter(spp == "UTST") %>% 
  filter(site %in% c("IBPE", "RABB", "EAST")) %>% 
  filter(tail %in% c("B", "W"))
  
```
